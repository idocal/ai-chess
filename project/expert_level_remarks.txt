Short Remarks on the Expert Level:

The expert level combines an improved heuristic for the scoring function together with a method for avoiding convergence to a local optimum:

1. Scoring function heuristic:
We would like to balance 4 things:

a.	Material score - Normal scoring based on piece ranking.

b.	Pawns Structure - The amount of defended pawns by other pawns is great for early game, we check for each pawn how many pawns are located in a position where they can re-conquer once it is conquered.

c.	Check Aiming - We added slight weight for a move that leads to a check, since normally performing a check is a good way to either dodge dangerous situation and moving towards checkmate.

d.	Possible Positions - We check for each piece how many possible moves there are and try to maximize, a rule of thumb in chess is that you want as many possible options as possible, especially during mid-game.

2. Avoiding convergence to a local optimum:
a. 	The Minimax algorithm is a greedy algorithm, thus may converge to a local optimum in case of a non convex scoring function.
	Trying to avoid that, we wanted to give the algorithm the option to choose non optimal moves at early stages of the game,
	hoping that exploring these moves will expose us to better moves at later stages of the game (reaching global optimum).

b.	In order to implement this idea, we used a pruning threshold which decreases as the game evolves (staring at 0.01, decreasing by 0.001 after every move).
	At each stage during the Minimax algorithm a random probability is generated and the specific branch is pruned if the probability is lower than the current threshold.
