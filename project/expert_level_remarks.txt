Short Remarks on the Expert Level:

The expert level combines an improved heuristic for the scoring function together with a method for avoiding convergence to a local optimum:

1. Scoring function heuristic:
//TODO: calman add 2-3 sentences here

2. Avoiding convergence to a local optimum:
a. 	The minmax algorithm is a greedy algorithm, thus may converge to a local optimum in case of a non convex scoring function.
	Trying to avoid that, we wanted to give the algorithm the option to choose non optimal moves at early stages of the game,
	hoping that exploring these moves will expose us to better moves at later stages of the game (reaching global optimum).

b.	In order to implement this idea, we used a prunning threshold which decreases as the game evolves (staring at 0.01,decreaing by 0.001 after every move).
	At each stage during the minmax algorithm a random probability is generated and the specific branch is pruned if the probability is lower then the current threshold.
